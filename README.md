# Linear_Regression_Advertisement

- Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable. The algorithm finds the best fit straight line relationship (linear equation) between the two variables. This statistical method is then used to predict the outcome of future events and is quite useful for predictive analysis.

- Suppose you want to determine the salary of a person based on the number of years of work experience they have. What is usually seen is as the number of years of experience increases, their salary increases. Now we can say that:

- Here years of experience is the independent variable. Itâ€™s a parameter that can be controlled or checked.
The Salary of the person is the dependent variable as its value depends on the years of work experience a person has.
The value of the dependent variable is predicted using the value of an independent variable.

- # What makes Linear Regression so Important?
- Linear regression makes it simple to understand the relation between two variables, which makes it important:

- This algorithm acts as a starting point for machine learning enthusiasts, making it quite simple to understand data.
- It helps in predictive analysis proving useful in many industries including marketing, finance, and even healthcare.
- It is the base for many advanced algorithms like logistic regression or neural networks.
- It is computationally efficient making it the most widely used statistical technique for regression tasks.
- The technique offers great performance in tasks for which the relationship between the variables is roughly linear.
